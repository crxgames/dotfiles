dotfiles
========

Dotfiles I have created to make life easier and to save time.

.gitconfig
========
Included the alias `git lol` which provides a colorized output of the branching structure with log messages


.nanorc and nanorc/
========
`GNU Nano` syntax highlighting files. .nanorc that I use for my most common VM's. Syntax files in `nanorc/` originate from [serialhex/nano-highlight] 
(https://github.com/serialhex/nano-highlight)

.tcshrc
========
[Tcsh] (https://github.com/tcsh-org/tcsh) dotfile I commonly use on my `FreeBSD` boxen.
